Following are the steps needed to build the DLL on Windows:

1) Install MinGW (GCC) Compiler Suite on Windows. The tested version is GCC 4.5.0

2) Unzip the file ...\External\Windows\CDM20812.zip in the folder ...\External\Windows\CDM20812
Note that the latest version of D2XX driver is available at http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm
If the latest version of the D2XX driver is used then the entry for EXTERNAL_INC_DIR in ...\LibMPSSE\Build\Windows will need to be changed accordingly.

3) In folder ...\LibMPSSE\Build\Windows run mingw32-make
This will build the file libMPSSE.dll

Note that to disable the debug prints from the DLL, the following lines needs to be commented
MACROS = -DINFRA_DEBUG_ENABLE
and the following line needs to be uncommented 
#MACROS = 


Also note that the ...\LibMPSSE\Build\Windows\b.bat script builds the DLL and a test application, and then runs it.
