There are two test routines that need to be run each time you check the boards.
One uses JTAG and the other uses I2C to perform different tests.

1) JTAG: This routine tests writing, erasing, and reading the EEPROM portion
and the I/O portion of the DS4550 devices.
There are 4 of these devices on each board.
The JTAG chain order is device 1 first, device 4 last.

2) I2C_tests:  This routine writes patterns on the I/O of the DS4550's
and reads the values back through analog switches.
There are 3 different switch types on the boards,
(2) SN74CBTLV3257PWR's, (1) SN74CBTLV3125PWR, (1) MAX4889AETO.
 
The JTAG communications is done through the HS2 adapter which plugs into
the 14-pin 2mm connector.
The I2C communications is done through the FT2232H-56Q Mini Module.

---------------------------

First Time Setup

if you are running 32bit linux
1) cd libraries_32bit 
2) sudo copy libftd2xx.* /usr/local/lib/.

if you are running 64bit linux
1) cd libraries_32bit 
2) sudo cp libftd2xx.* /usr/local/lib/.
3) copy libftd2xx.* into  JTAG_promtests/libftd2xx/release/examples/JTAG/.
4) copy libftd2xx.* into  I2C_iotests/Release-I2C/samples/I2/.

compiling libMPSSE (both 32bit and 64bit linux)
1) cd I2C_iotests/LibMPSSE-I2C/LibMPSSE/Build/Linux
2) make clean; make;
3) sudo cp libMPSSE.* /usr/local/lib/.
4) copy libMPSSE.* into  JTAG_promtests/libftd2xx/release/examples/JTAG/.
5) copy libMPSSE.* into  I2C_iotests/Release-I2C/samples/I2/.


-----------------------------

to compile JTAG routines

1) cd  JTAG_promtests/libftd2xx/release/examples/JTAG
2) make clean
3) make

to run JTAG routines

1) cd JTAG_promtests/libftd2xx/release/examples/JTAG
2) sudo ./JTAG
3) file is output to jtag_board_data in this directory

JTAG may require ftdi driver  is running

1) lsmod | grep ftdi_sio
2) if not there load the drivers:
sudo insmod /lib/modules/2.6.32-642.15.1.el6.i686/kernel/drivers/usb/serial/usbserial.ko
sudo insmod /lib/modules/2.6.32-642.15.1.el6.i686/kernel/drivers/usb/serial/ftdi_sio.ko


------------------------------

to compile I2C routines

1) cd i2c_run
2)./bash.b
3) choose 1 


to run I2C routines

1) cd i2c_run
2) cd I2C
3) sudo ./I2C_tests

for I2C driver 

I2C will require ftdi driver not to be there. This happens
everytime you power down or unplug any of the cables.

1) lsmod | grep ftdi_sio
2) if there:
   sudo rmmod ftdi_sio
